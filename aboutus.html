                            Gan and his family built Baan Maka around the year 2000. Gan set about providing everything amatuer naturalists and professional bird guides and their customers would need in order to maximise their days in the park and the local hides. It soon established itself as the premier lodge in the Kaeng Krachan area and is the first choice for nature guides and photographers.<br><br>Gan has decided to take a break from running Baan Maka to head off and pursue his own wildlife based hobbies.<br><br>From Sep 1st 2017 Punjapa Phetsri will be the manager and will strive to continue Gan's good work and hopefully add some new facilities and activities to the lodge.</p>

                            Punjapa Phetsri (Games), is well known in the Thai birding world having owned and run the bird guiding company South Thailand Birding for many years. She has now decided that occasionly during the high season it would be nice to sleep in her own bed rather than being on the road the whole time. The intention is to managa Baan Maka while doing some guiding locally. Although this is Games's first venture into the accomodation business she has been in the guiding world long enough to know what the naturalist wants from a lodge.<br><br>Ian, being a Brit, is not allowed to work in Thailand for which he is truly thankful as he has been able to spend most of the last 15 years travelling the country learning about, and photographing, the wildlife. He will be living on site (when not out and about exploring) and just loves to talk about birds, geckos, butterflies, frogs, rats, bats, etc, etc, etc.<br></p>
